- Process of PUBLIC teaching



Every prompt will be stored as well as the result. 
When a video is generated it will ask for feedback (YES, NO)

Then it will save the prompt and the result in the database.
If result ends up with "NO" then this video will not be sent anymore. 
It will wait for the same prompt and someone has to click "yes" then it will update the AI to send the correct video.

So first we make a check if there is the same prompt in the database. If there is the same prompt and result = YES we send the video.
If prompt is the same and result = NO we dont send the stored video but we send different video and we wait for them to click YES so we can update the database.

If there is no PRMOPT in the database we send feedback and review.
If there is PRMOPT and result = YES we never send feedback again.

If link is expired we delete result and send other video
